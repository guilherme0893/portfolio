                      <p>Hi there!</p>
                      <p>
                        It is very good to see new faces here!
                        I am Guilherme Duarte, currently I am a web development student at Trybe.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I have a BSc (2012) and  MSc (2021) in Geology obtained in Rio de Janeiro Federal University.
                        There, I was focused in the study of evaporites rocks, specially gypsum and anhydrite, from Araripe and Parna√≠ba Basins where we can find analogues to the Brazilian Pre-Salt succession.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Then, I decided that it was about time to shake things a little bit and decided to join Trybe and learn more about coding and web development.
                        So far, the journey has been incridible and full of new discoveries.
