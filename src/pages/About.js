                      <p>Hi there!</p>
                      <p>
                        It is very good to see new faces here!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I am Guilherme Duarte, currently I am a full stack web development student at Trybe.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        I also have a BSc (2012) and  a MSc (2021) in Geology obtained from Rio de Janeiro Federal University.
                        There, I was focused in the study of evaporites rocks, specially gypsum and anhydrite, from Araripe and Parna√≠ba Basins where we can find analogues to the Brazilian Pre-Salt succession.
                        You can find more about my education bellow.
                        Curiously, it was during my MSc that I first had contact with coding and this world, that felt like to be so far from me.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        So I decided that it was about time to shake things and then learn more about coding, so I joined Trybe last August.
                        Web development was the choice, and this intense journey has been incridible and full of new discoveries.
